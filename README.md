# Datat-Structures-and-Algorithms-University-Project

The objective of this project was to design and implement a dictionary data structure. The dictionary holds a list of words to be used in a spell checker.

I have implemented the following operations to the data structure:
1.	Initialization 

2.	Adding a new word to the dictionary.

3.	Searching for word in the dictionary.

4.	Removing a word from the dictionary.

5.	Searching for similar words to a given word.
